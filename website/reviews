						<p>  When first spawned in this server you are greeted by a magnificent dark - themed castle structure and a road leading into the vast savanna of vanilla survival.  I was then greeted by everyone present on the server. No, not those auto-greetings  you get from server staff, but an actual welcome from players just like me.</p>
						<p>  Unfortunately this is where the first problem arose.  I didn' t know where to go!  If the co-owner weren't online at the time I wouldn't have known where to go next.  On the bright side the staff are the best of what you could imagine.  Which gave me a feeling of inclusiveness and welcoming.</p>
						<p>  One of the things that stood out from the beginning was the purple theme and the gem system. The gem system was clear and easy to use.  Gems are a great way to purchase perks like flying, hats, and XP boosts which are very beneficial to progressing in vanilla survival which is the highlight of the server. With the gem perks and the use of the Ulticraft Android app.  The survival experience is sped up and enhanced. I mean, who wants to stand around punching wood and mining all day?  With all of the time saved, you can socialize more with the tightly knit community of other crafters using the Towny plugin; a popular town building utility that let's players create and invite others to their very own town.</p>
						<p>  The best thing I like about this server is its originality.  This server includes a custom plugin that let's you up link to an android device to view your current player stats as well as view vanilla minecraft guides.  Another unique feature of Ulticraft is its flexible economy.  Each player earns money by selling resources they have aquired for money that they can use to buy from shops or other players.  Every time a purchase is made, the price of that item will change.  For example; if you sell 10 diamonds for $1.5K the buying price of diamonds go down by a lot and vise versa.  Most servers with an economy have a FIXED economy that can be controlled by server staff.  In my opinion, let the players set the prices and all will even out, which is clear with the economy on Ulticraft.</p>
						<p>  Some of the more common features that Ulticraft has are mob arenas and creative plot building.  These are more popular standard server features that I won't go into too much detail about.  The mob arena includes two arenas which are custom built for Ulticraft and are strategically made to be difficult for the player to survive which I think is a much needed improvement over standard mob arenas.</p>
						<p>  Over all, Ulticraft so far, is the best small server I have been on.  The developers and creators are definitlely on the right track to success, and I hope that they never stop improving.  This servers originality and creativity earned it such high rankings  with the CPR score and my personal opinions. Special thanks to Sir_Sabre(Co-Owner) and Vertical19(Moderator) for helping me in my review of the server.  If you are one of those techi kind of pepole I will provide a link below to where you can see the technical details and stats of the server.</p>
